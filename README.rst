of Cuckoo is undergoing and will be announced soon.**

Cuckoo Sandbox is the leading open source
automated malware analysis system.

What does that mean? It simply means that you can throw any suspicious file at
it and in a matter of seconds Cuckoo will provide you back some detailed
results outlining what such file did when executed inside an isolated
environment.
